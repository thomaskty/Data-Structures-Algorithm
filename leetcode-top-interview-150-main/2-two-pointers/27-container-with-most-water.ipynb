    "The time and space complexity of the implemented function can be analyzed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time Complexity**: The function uses a two-pointer approach where each pointer starts at opposite ends of the array and moves towards the center. In the worst case, each pointer traverses the entire array once. This results in a time complexity of \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the input array. This is because each element in the array is visited at most once by either of the two pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Space Complexity**: The function uses a constant amount of extra space, irrespective of the size of the input array. There are no data structures that grow with the size of the input. Only a fixed number of variables (pointers and a variable to track the maximum area) are used. Therefore, the space complexity is \\(O(1)\\), which means it requires constant space."
