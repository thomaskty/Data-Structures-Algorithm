    "# Question 32 - 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.\n",
    "\n",
    "A concatenated substring in s is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if `words = [\"ab\",\"cd\",\"ef\"]`, then \"`abcdef`\", \"`abefcd`\", \"`cdabef`\", \"`cdefab`\", \"`efabcd`\", and \"`efcdab`\" are all concatenated strings. \"`acdbef`\" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.\n",
    "Return _the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s._ You can return the answer in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"barfoothefoobarman\", words = [\"foo\",\"bar\"]\n",
    "    Output: [0,9]\n",
    "    Explanation: Since words.length == 2 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.\n",
    "    The substring starting at 0 is \"barfoo\". It is the concatenation of [\"bar\",\"foo\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "    The substring starting at 9 is \"foobar\". It is the concatenation of [\"foo\",\"bar\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "    The output order does not matter. Returning [9,0] is fine too.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"wordgoodgoodgoodbestword\", words = [\"word\",\"good\",\"best\",\"word\"]\n",
    "    Output: []\n",
    "    Explanation: Since words.length == 4 and words[i].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.\n",
    "    There is no substring of length 16 in s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.\n",
    "    We return an empty array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"barfoofoobarthefoobarman\", words = [\"bar\",\"foo\",\"the\"]\n",
    "    Output: [6,9,12]\n",
    "    Explanation: Since words.length == 3 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.\n",
    "    The substring starting at 6 is \"foobarthe\". It is the concatenation of [\"foo\",\"bar\",\"the\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "    The substring starting at 9 is \"barthefoo\". It is the concatenation of [\"bar\",\"the\",\"foo\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "    The substring starting at 12 is \"thefoobar\". It is the concatenation of [\"the\",\"foo\",\"bar\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= s.length <= 104`\n",
    "- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`\n",
    "- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`\n",
    "- `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.\n"

    "The complexity of the solution for finding concatenated substrings with a permutation of given words can be analyzed in terms of time and space complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Outer Loop**: We iterate through the string `s`, but only up to `(len(s) - words_total_length + 1)`. This is because any starting index beyond this point would not have enough characters left in the string to form a concatenated substring of the required length. The loop runs approximately `O(N)` times, where `N` is the length of the string `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Inner Loop & Check Function**: For each starting index, we check if a valid concatenated substring exists. This check involves iterating over the substring in increments of the word length, leading to approximately `word_count` iterations (where `word_count` is the number of words in the `words` list). Within each iteration, operations like slicing (`O(L)` where `L` is the word length) and dictionary lookups (`O(1)`) are performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Therefore, the complexity for the check function per outer loop iteration is approximately `O(word_count * L)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these, the total time complexity is approximately `O(N * word_count * L)`. However, it's worth noting that the actual runtime can be lower due to early terminations in the check function when a non-matching word is encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Word Frequency Counter**: We store the frequency of each word in `words`, which takes `O(word_count)` space.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Seen Counter in Check Function**: A similar counter is used to track the words seen in the current substring, also requiring `O(word_count)` space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall space complexity is `O(word_count)`, as the size of the counters depends on the number of distinct words in the `words` list, and does not scale with the size of the input string `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the solution has a time complexity of `O(N * word_count * L)` and a space complexity of `O(word_count)`.\n"
