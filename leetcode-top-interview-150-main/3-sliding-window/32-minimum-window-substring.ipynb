    "# Question 31 - LC 76. Minimum Window Substring\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the minimum window substring of s* such that every character in `t (including duplicates)` is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `\"\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"ADOBECODEBANC\", t = \"ABC\"\n",
    "    Output: \"BANC\"\n",
    "    Explanation: The minimum window substring \"BANC\" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"a\", t = \"a\"\n",
    "    Output: \"a\"\n",
    "    Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"a\", t = \"aa\"\n",
    "    Output: \"\"\n",
    "    Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.\n",
    "    Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `m == s.length`\n",
    "- `n == t.length`\n",
    "- `1 <= m, n <= 105`\n",
    "- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Follow up**: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?"

    "To solve the \"Minimum Window Substring\" problem, we can use the sliding window technique. The idea is to expand and contract a window on string `s` to find the smallest substring that contains all the characters of string `t`. This can be achieved in `O(m + n)` time, where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a Frequency Map for `t`**: First, we create a frequency map (hash map) to count the occurrences of each character in `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sliding Window**: Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, both set to 0. These pointers define the current window on `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expand the Window**: Move the `end` pointer to the right, adding characters from `s` into a frequency map for the current window until all characters from `t` are included in the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Contract the Window**: Once all characters from `t` are included, move the `start` pointer to the right to shrink the window until the window no longer contains all the characters of `t`. Each time a valid window is found, compare its length with the minimum length found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Update Minimum Window**: If the current window length is smaller than the previously recorded minimum, update the minimum length and remember the starting index of this window.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Repeat Steps 3-5**: Continue this process until `end` reaches the end of `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Return Result**: If a valid window is found, return the substring from `s`; otherwise, return an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the \"Minimum Window Substring\" algorithm works as expected. Here are the results for the provided examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For `s = \"ADOBECODEBANC\"` and `t = \"ABC\"`, the output is `\"BANC\"`. This is the minimum window in `s` that contains all characters of `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For `s = \"a\"` and `t = \"a\"`, the output is `\"a\"`. The entire string `s` is the minimum window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For `s = \"a\"` and `t = \"aa\"`, the output is `\"\"`. There is no window in `s` that contains both 'a's from `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution efficiently finds the minimum window substring in `O(m + n)` time, where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`.\n"
