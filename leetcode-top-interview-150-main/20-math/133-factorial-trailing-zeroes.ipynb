    "To determine the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given number $ n $, we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in $ n! $. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, and there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimal Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal approach involves counting the multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one factor of 5, each multiple of 25 contributes an additional factor of 5, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a counter to zero.\n",
    "2. Divide $ n $ by 5 and add the quotient to the counter.\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 with $ n $ divided by 25, 125, etc., until $ n $ divided by the current power of 5 is zero.\n",
    "4. The counter will then contain the number of trailing zeroes in $ n! $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization**: Start with `zeroes = 0` and `power = 5`.\n",
    "- **Loop**: While $ n $ divided by the current power of 5 is greater than zero:\n",
    "  - Add the integer division of $ n $ by the current power of 5 to `zeroes`.\n",
    "  - Multiply the power of 5 by 5 for the next iteration.\n",
    "- **Return**: The total count of trailing zeroes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**: $ O(\\log_5 n) $. The loop runs approximately $ \\log_5 n $ times because we divide $ n $ by increasing powers of 5.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: $ O(1) $. The algorithm uses a constant amount of space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "For $ n = 100 $:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $ 100 // 5 = 20 $ (20 multiples of 5)\n",
    "2. $ 100 // 25 = 4 $ (4 multiples of 25)\n",
    "3. $ 100 // 125 = 0 $ (no multiples of 125)\n",
    "\n",
    "Total trailing zeroes = 20 + 4 = 24.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method ensures that we count all factors of 5, including those contributed by higher powers of 5, leading to an accurate count of trailing zeroes in $ n! $.\n",
