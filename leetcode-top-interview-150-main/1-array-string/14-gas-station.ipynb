    "# Question 14 - 134. Gas Station\n",
    "\n",
    "There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `i-th` station is `gas[i]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the ith station to its next `(i + 1)-th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the _starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction_, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is **guaranteed** to be **unique**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]\n",
    "    Output: 3\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "    Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\n",
    "    Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8\n",
    "    Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7\n",
    "    Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6\n",
    "    Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5\n",
    "    Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.\n",
    "    Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]\n",
    "    Output: -1\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "    You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.\n",
    "    Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4\n",
    "    Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3\n",
    "    Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3\n",
    "    You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.\n",
    "    Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.\n"

    "To analyze the complexity of the `can_complete_circuit` function, we'll look at its time and space complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "   - The function includes a single for loop that iterates over each element of the `gas` and `cost` arrays exactly once.\n",
    "   - The operations inside the loop (calculating `tank`, checking conditions) are constant time operations.\n",
    "   - Therefore, the time complexity is \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of gas stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Space Complexity:**\n",
    "   - The function uses a fixed amount of extra space for variables like `start` and `tank`.\n",
    "   - This space requirement does not depend on the size of the input arrays.\n",
    "   - Thus, the space complexity is \\( O(1) \\), indicating constant space usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the function is efficient in terms of both time and space, with a linear time complexity and constant space complexity."
