    "Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.**\n",

    "To solve the problem of determining if a linked list has a cycle using constant memory (\\(O(1)\\)), we can employ the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm. This algorithm uses two pointers that move at different speeds, a slow pointer (tortoise) that moves one step at a time and a fast pointer (hare) that moves two steps at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, at the head of the list.\n",
    "2. Move the slow pointer one step at a time and the fast pointer two steps at a time.\n",
    "3. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list (null).\n",
    "4. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer within the cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this works is that if there is a cycle, the fast pointer will enter the cycle and will start to loop around it. Since the slow pointer is also moving but at half the speed, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer, indicating a cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function defines a basic `ListNode` class to represent each node in the linked list. The `hasCycle` function then checks if there is a cycle in the list by using the Tortoise and Hare algorithm. It returns `True` if there is a cycle, otherwise `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach meets the constraint of using \\(O(1)\\) memory, as it only uses two pointers regardless of the size of the linked list.\n"
