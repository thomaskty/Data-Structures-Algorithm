    "# Question 24 - 68. Text Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.\n",
    "Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.\n",
    "The input array words contains at least one word.\n",

    "    Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.\n",

    "The expression `(base_space + (i < extra))` in the revised `full_justify` function is used to calculate the number of spaces to be added between words when distributing spaces evenly in a justified line. Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`base_space`**: This represents the base number of spaces that should be added between each pair of words. It is calculated by dividing the total number of spaces to be distributed (`spaces`, which is `maxWidth - number_of_letters`) by the number of gaps between words (`gaps`, which is `len(current_line) - 1` or 1 if there's only one word).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`(i < extra)`**: This is a boolean expression that evaluates to `True` if `i` is less than `extra`, and `False` otherwise. In Python, `True` is equivalent to 1, and `False` is equivalent to 0. The variable `extra` is the remainder from the division of the total spaces by the number of gaps, obtained from `divmod(spaces, gaps)`. It represents the number of extra spaces that need to be distributed after each gap gets `base_space` number of spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining them**: The expression `(base_space + (i < extra))` adds these base spaces to each gap, and for the first `extra` gaps, it adds one additional space (since `i < extra` will be `True`, and thus add 1). This effectively distributes the extra spaces starting from the leftmost gap, ensuring more even spacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you need to distribute 5 spaces across 3 gaps (`base_space = 1, extra = 2`), the first two gaps will get 2 spaces each (`base_space + 1`), and the last gap will get only 1 space (`base_space`). This method ensures that the extra spaces are distributed as evenly as possible across the gaps."

    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iteration Over Words**: The primary operation is iterating over each word in the `words` list. If there are `n` words in the input list, the loop iterates `n` times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Space Distribution Calculations**: Inside the loop, the function performs calculations to distribute spaces and form a justified line. These calculations include division, modulo operations, and iterating over each word in the current line to add spaces. However, the number of iterations for adding spaces is bounded by the number of words in a line, which is at most `n`. In practice, it's typically much less since words are spread across multiple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **String Operations**: The function constructs strings by joining words and spaces. The time complexity for string concatenation in Python is generally O(k), where k is the length of the string being concatenated. Since the function constructs strings up to `maxWidth` in length, this operation is O(maxWidth) for each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering these factors, the worst-case time complexity is O(n \\* maxWidth). This is because, in the worst case, each word could be in a separate line (e.g., very long maxWidth), leading to `n` iterations of space calculations and string concatenations, each of which is O(maxWidth).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Storage of Result and Current Line**: The function uses additional space to store the result (`result`) and the current line being processed (`current_line`). The space required for `result` is O(n \\* maxWidth), as it stores each word and necessary spaces to form lines of `maxWidth` length. The space for `current_line` is at most O(maxWidth) since it stores words of a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Temporary Variables**: The function uses a few additional variables for counting letters and distributing spaces, but these require constant space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the overall space complexity is O(n \\* maxWidth), dominated by the storage required for the `result` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `full_justify` function has a time complexity of O(n _ maxWidth) and a space complexity of O(n _ maxWidth), where `n` is the number of words in the input list, and `maxWidth` is the maximum width of a line.\n"
