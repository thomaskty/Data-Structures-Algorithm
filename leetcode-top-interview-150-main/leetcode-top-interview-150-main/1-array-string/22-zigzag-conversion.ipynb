    "To analyze the complexity of the provided Zigzag Conversion algorithm, we'll consider both time complexity and space complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterating Over the String**: The algorithm iterates through each character of the string `s` exactly once. If the length of the string is `n`, this results in `O(n)` time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Appending Characters to Rows**: For each character in the string, the algorithm appends it to one of the `numRows` strings. The appending operation is generally `O(1)` for strings in Python, as Python strings are dynamic arrays at a low level. However, when the underlying array needs resizing, it can momentarily cause a higher cost, but this is still amortized `O(1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining Rows into a Single String**: After processing the characters, the algorithm combines `numRows` strings into one. The total number of characters across all rows is `n`, so this operation is `O(n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these considerations, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rows Storage**: The algorithm uses a list of strings to store the characters in each row. The total space used by all these rows combined is equal to the length of the input string `s`, which is `O(n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Auxiliary Space**: The variables used for iteration and control flow (`current_row`, `going_down`) use constant space, `O(1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the overall space complexity of the algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Zigzag Conversion algorithm is efficient in terms of time, with a linear time complexity relative to the input size, and uses linear space to store the intermediate representations of the zigzag pattern."
