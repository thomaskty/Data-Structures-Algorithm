    "# Question 52 - LC 71. Simplify Path\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the **current directory**, a double period `'..'` refers to **the directory up a level**, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `canonical path` should have the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.\n",
    "2. Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.\n",
    "3. The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.\n",
    "4. The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the simplified canonical path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: path = \"/home/\"\n",
    "    Output: \"/home\"\n",
    "    Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: path = \"/../\"\n",
    "    Output: \"/\"\n",
    "    Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: path = \"/home//foo/\"\n",
    "    Output: \"/home/foo\"\n",
    "    Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `1 <= path.length <= 3000`\n",
    "2. `path` consists of English letters, digits, period `'.'`, slash `'/'` or `'_'`.\n",
    "3. `path` is a valid absolute Unix path.\n"
