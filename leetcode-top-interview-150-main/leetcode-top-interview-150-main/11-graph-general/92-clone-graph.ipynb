    "# **Question 90 - 133. Clone Graph**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty:** Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topics:** Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Graph, Hash Table\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to create a deep copy of a connected undirected graph. You're provided with a reference to a node within the graph. Each node has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **val:** An integer value representing the node.\n",
    "- **neighbors:** A list of neighboring nodes (List[Node]).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is an adjacency list (a list of lists) representing the graph. To maintain simplicity, node values correspond to their index in the adjacency list (1-indexed).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a reference to the cloned graph's root node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]\n",
    "Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]\n",
    "Explanation: (See problem description for detailed explanation)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: adjList = [[]]\n",
    "Output: [[]]\n",
    "Explanation:  A single node with no neighbors.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: adjList = []\n",
    "Output: []\n",
    "Explanation: An empty graph.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 <= Number of nodes <= 100\n",
    "- 1 <= Node.val <= 100\n",
    "- Node.val is unique.\n",
    "- The graph is connected (all nodes reachable from the given node).\n",
    "- No self-loops or repeated edges exist."
