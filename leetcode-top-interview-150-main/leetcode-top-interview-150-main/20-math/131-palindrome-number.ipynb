    "The time complexity of the provided method for checking if a number is a palindrome is $O(\\log_{10}(n))$ because the number of iterations in the while loop is proportional to the number of digits in the number $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Digits**:\n",
    "   - The number of digits $d$ in a number $n$ can be determined using the formula:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     d = \\lfloor \\log_{10}(n) \\rfloor + 1\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - This means that if $n$ has $d$ digits, then $d \\approx \\log_{10}(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **While Loop Iterations**:\n",
    "   - In the provided code, the while loop continues until $n$ becomes 0.\n",
    "   - In each iteration, the number $n$ is divided by 10 ($n = n // 10$), effectively removing the last digit of $n$.\n",
    "   - Therefore, the number of iterations of the while loop is equal to the number of digits in $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "   - Since the number of digits in $n$ is $\\log_{10}(n)$, the while loop runs $\\log_{10}(n)$ times.\n",
    "   - Each iteration of the loop involves a constant amount of work (extracting the last digit and updating the reversed number), which is $O(1)$.\n",
    "   - Thus, the overall time complexity is $O(\\log_{10}(n))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- The space complexity is $O(1)$ because the algorithm uses a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input number $n$.\n",

    "The formula $ d = \\left\\lfloor \\log_{10}(n) \\right\\rfloor + 1 $ is used to determine the number of digits $ d $ in a positive integer $ n $. Here's a detailed explanation of why this formula works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logarithmic Relationship**:\n",
    "   - The base-10 logarithm of a number $ n $, denoted as $ \\log_{10}(n) $, gives the power to which 10 must be raised to obtain $ n $.\n",
    "   - For example, $ \\log_{10}(1000) = 3 $ because $ 10^3 = 1000 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Range of Digits**:\n",
    "   - A number $ n $ with $ d $ digits lies in the range $ [10^{d-1}, 10^d - 1] $.\n",
    "   - For instance, a 3-digit number lies between $ 100 $ and $ 999 $, inclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inequality Representation**:\n",
    "   - If $ n $ has $ d $ digits, then:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     10^{d-1} \\leq n < 10^d\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - Taking the base-10 logarithm of all parts of the inequality:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     \\log_{10}(10^{d-1}) \\leq \\log_{10}(n) < \\log_{10}(10^d)\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - Simplifying the logarithms:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     d-1 \\leq \\log_{10}(n) < d\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Floor Function**:\n",
    "   - The floor function $ \\left\\lfloor x \\right\\rfloor $ gives the greatest integer less than or equal to $ x $.\n",
    "   - From the inequality $ d-1 \\leq \\log_{10}(n) < d $, we can deduce:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     d-1 = \\left\\lfloor \\log_{10}(n) \\right\\rfloor\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - Therefore:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     d = \\left\\lfloor \\log_{10}(n) \\right\\rfloor + 1\n",
    "     $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply this to an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider $ n = 5000 $.\n",
    "- Calculate $ \\log_{10}(5000) $:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  \\log_{10}(5000) \\approx 3.6990\n",
    "  $\n",
    "- Apply the floor function:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  \\left\\lfloor 3.6990 \\right\\rfloor = 3\n",
    "  $\n",
    "- Add 1 to get the number of digits:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  d = 3 + 1 = 4\n",
    "  $\n",
    "- Thus, $ 5000 $ has 4 digits, which is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula $ d = \\left\\lfloor \\log_{10}(n) \\right\\rfloor + 1 $ works because it leverages the properties of logarithms to determine the range in which the number $ n $ falls, and the floor function helps in identifying the correct number of digits by rounding down the logarithmic value to the nearest integer and then adjusting by adding 1."
