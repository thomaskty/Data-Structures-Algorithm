    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of this algorithm is primarily influenced by several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Starting Points**: Every cell in the `m x n` grid can potentially be the starting point for the search. Therefore, the search initiates from each of these points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Search Depth**: The depth of the recursive search corresponds to the length of the word, `l`. In the worst case, the recursive function might explore all possible paths in the grid emanating from a starting point until it either completes the word or exhausts all possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Branching Factor**: At each cell, the algorithm has up to 4 possible directions to explore: up, down, left, right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these factors, the worst-case time complexity can be estimated as `O(m * n * 4^l)`. This represents the worst-case scenario where each recursive call has 4 choices (ignoring boundary cells and previously visited checks for simplicity), and the recursion goes up to `l` levels deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of the algorithm involves considering the space used by the recursion stack during the depth-first search:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recursion Stack**: In the worst case, the recursion stack can go as deep as the length of the word, `l`, which is the maximum depth of the DFS. Thus, the space complexity for the recursion stack is `O(l)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Board Modification**: Since the board is modified in place to mark visited cells and restored afterward, no additional space proportional to the board size is required beyond the input itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the space complexity is `O(l)` for the recursion stack. If you consider the input space (i.e., the board itself), you might also include `O(m * n)` as the total input space requirement, but this is not additional space created by the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pruning**: The use of backtracking helps prune the search space early if a path is clearly not leading to a solution, which can significantly improve average performance, though the worst-case time complexity remains exponential.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimization**: In practical implementations for larger boards or longer words, additional optimizations like checking for the presence of all characters in the word within the board beforehand or using a more efficient data structure (like a trie for prefix checking in case of multiple words) can be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis gives a thorough understanding of how the algorithm scales with input size and word length, which is crucial for assessing its feasibility for larger problems."
