    "Given a set of equations represented as `equations[i] = [Ai, Bi]` with corresponding values `values[i]` indicating `Ai / Bi = values[i]`, and a set of queries `[Cj, Dj]` asking for `Cj / Dj`, return the results for each query.\n",

    "\n",
    "You are provided with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `equations`: An array of variable pairs, where `equations[i] = [Ai, Bi]` and `values[i]` represents the division `Ai / Bi = values[i]`. Here, `Ai` and `Bi` are strings representing variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "Your task is to return the answers to all queries as a list of double values. If a query's answer cannot be determined due to the variables being undefined or disconnected in the context of given `equations`, return `-1.0`.\n",

    "The time complexity of the solution using Depth-First Search (DFS) to solve the \"Evaluate Division\" problem can be analyzed based on the number of equations and queries provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Construction**:\n",
    "   - For each equation, we insert two edges into the graph (for `A / B` and `B / A`). Given that the number of equations is `E`, this part of the algorithm runs in \\(O(E)\\) time, as each insertion into a dictionary (hash map) is generally \\(O(1)\\) on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DFS Execution per Query**:\n",
    "   - In the worst case, DFS will need to traverse the entire graph to find a path from the source node to the target node or determine that no such path exists. If we assume there are `V` unique variables, the complexity of a single DFS call can be up to \\(O(V + E)\\) because each node and edge is potentially visited once in the search. The `V` comes from visiting each node once, and `E` is from traversing each edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling All Queries**:\n",
    "   - If there are `Q` queries, and each query invokes a DFS which could take \\(O(V + E)\\), the total complexity for all queries would be \\(O(Q \\times (V + E))\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Time Complexity**:\n",
    "- Given the constraints where \\(1 \\leq E, Q \\leq 20\\), the variables \\(V\\) can be at most \\(2E\\) (each equation can introduce at most two unique variables). Hence, in a dense scenario where each variable is connected, the complexity can be framed as \\(O(Q \\times (V + E))\\). Considering the provided constraints, \\(V\\) and \\(E\\) are approximately bounded by the same order. Thus, the total time complexity can be approximately \\(O(Q \\times E)\\), but more accurately expressed as \\(O(Q \\times (V + E))\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practical terms, for the limits given (with \\(E\\) and \\(Q\\) up to 20), this time complexity is manageable and the solution should perform efficiently. The use of DFS is particularly suited to this problem given the graph's likely sparsity and the manageable size of `E` and `Q`, allowing each query to be processed relatively quickly."

    "The space complexity of the solution using Depth-First Search (DFS) to solve the \"Evaluate Division\" problem primarily involves storing the graph and handling the DFS calls. Here's how it breaks down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Storage**:\n",
    "   - Each equation results in two entries in the graph: one for \\( A / B \\) and another for \\( B / A \\). If there are \\( E \\) equations, and each equation introduces two nodes and two edges (one for each direction), the graph will require space proportional to the number of edges, which can be at most \\( 2E \\). Each node is stored with its adjacent nodes and corresponding weights.\n",
    "   - Since each equation introduces at most two unique variables, the number of nodes \\( V \\) is at most \\( 2E \\). The storage for the graph, considering nodes and edges, is therefore \\( O(V + E) \\), which simplifies to \\( O(E) \\) because \\( V \\) and \\( E \\) are linearly related.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DFS Call Stack**:\n",
    "   - In the worst case, the DFS will recursively visit all nodes in the graph once. The recursion stack depth, in this case, could be up to \\( V \\), which is the number of unique variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visited Set**:\n",
    "   - Each DFS call for a query uses a set to track visited nodes to prevent cycles and revisits. This set can grow to include all nodes in the graph, making its space requirement \\( O(V) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Query Results Storage**:\n",
    "   - You also need to store the results for each query. If there are \\( Q \\) queries, the space required to store these results is \\( O(Q) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Space Complexity**:\n",
    "- Summing these components, the dominant factors are the graph storage and the DFS stack/visited set:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  O(V + E) + O(V) + O(Q) = O(V + E + Q)\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "- Given that \\( V \\) can be at most \\( 2E \\), and both \\( V \\) and \\( E \\) are related to the number of equations, the space complexity simplifies to \\( O(E + Q) \\), considering \\( V \\approx E \\) in practical scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the overall space complexity for the algorithm, considering all aspects, is dominated by the graph storage and the DFS recursion/visited tracking, fitting within a manageable range given the problem constraints (with \\( E \\) and \\( Q \\) up to 20). This space requirement ensures that the algorithm is efficient in terms of memory usage for the given problem size."
